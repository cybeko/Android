[Intro]
Let the blackness roll on

[Verse 1]
Mother's cool reptilian womb
Ain't so cold tonight
My fingers trace the exit wounds
By graveyard light
There's bone dust in my throat and everything is dead
But it's all right

[Refrain]
Take it easy
You bleed so easy

[Bridge]
Bleed me an ocean
Bleed me an ocean tonight
By electric graveyard light
Bleed me an ocean
Let me lie beneath the sky
Teach me how to die
Bleed me an ocean
As the blossom eats the butterfly
Can you feel the cold death
That rides along your spine

[Chorus]
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Let the blackness roll on

[Verse 2]
I was sexless in clouds again
I was chasing a cold, cold wind
I've become bored with flesh and bone again
The deepest alone
I was riding the turbulence
An ocean of Hades
It's all downhill from here
On the outer nowhere

[Chorus]
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Let the blackness roll on

[Verse 3]
I was stoned to the drone
Of the blackness that hums
I've become bored with flesh and bone again
The endless hum of the highway drone
I was riding the turbulence
An ocean of Hades
The taste of dead sex on my tongue
On my tongue, yeah
[Chorus]
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy
Let the blackness roll on
You bleed so easy

[Bridge 2]
Just like a rain drop
I was born, baby, to fall
And scale these prison walls

[Bridge 3]
It was over before you were born
Sucked into the vacuum of this universal tomb
It was over before you were born
Sucked into the vacuum of this universal tomb

[Verse 4]
Old blossom dies
Like a young man breathes
The insects hum with their hunger and grieve
An icon of pale bone
Static white dream
Blind in the wilderness
Everybody scream
I couldn't find my way
Out the door
We all died
Woke up on the floor
[Outro]
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
I ride the painted whore
She gives good universal scream, scream
